# Stock Market Volatility Analysis

An end-to-end machine learning project focused on analyzing stock market volatility to uncover trends, assess risk, and generate actionable insights from historical market data.

This project applies data analysis, statistical methods, and machine learning techniques to better understand how volatility behaves across different market conditions.

## 🔍 Overview

Stock market volatility is a key indicator of market uncertainty and investment risk. Understanding volatility patterns helps investors, analysts, and financial institutions make informed decisions.

In this project, I analyze historical stock price data to:
- Identify volatility trends
- Detect high-risk periods
- Explore patterns using dimensionality reduction and clustering
- Apply machine learning models for deeper analytical insights

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical stock data  
- Measure and visualize market volatility  
- Identify trends and anomalies during volatile periods  
- Apply machine learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns  
- Interpret results from a risk and market-behavior perspective
